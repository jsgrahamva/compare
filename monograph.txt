Business Function Framework Function(s): Manage Health Records, Utilize Information Technology Services

VHA Portfolio: Common Services

VASI ID: NA

Full Description and Features: 
The overall process is broken down into these phases:  

1.	Duplicate patient records are identified by the VAMC staff or by a separate system interfaced with the Master Patient Index
2.	VAMC staff review/verify the pairs and approve the pairs.
3.	VAMC IT or expert users schedule and monitor merges of the pairs.

Initial search and identification of potential duplicate records is accomplished by performing comparisons on key patient traits in the centralized Person Service Identify Management (PSIM) database. It is the goal of PSIM to provide an authoritative source for persons’ identity traits throughout the Veterans Health Administration (VHA).
The review/verification phase of the patient merge process consists of two levels of review before verification. The primary reviewer performs a review of patient demographic information and determines if the pair is a duplicate record, then selects the record that will be merged into the other record, which is known as the merge direction. When data from ancillary services is present, a notification (via Mailman message or alert or both) is sent to the designated ancillary reviewers.
All reviewers determine whether the record pair is a duplicate, not a duplicate, or unable to determine the status. If all reviewers conclude that the pairs are duplicates and need to be merged, the record pair is designated as a verified duplicate available for merge approval. For those pairs determined not to be duplicates, the processing stops and the status indicates they are verified as non-duplicates. If status cannot be determined, the record pair remains in the DUPLICATE RECORD file and processing ends unless the Healthcare Identity Management and Data Quality team can assist and determine the resolution.
The next phase is the merge of the record pairs. A wait time may be configured between verification and merge. The merge is a non-reversible process. Once the pair of records is merged, there is no automated way of undoing the process. The application has been written to support multiple parallel jobs (threads - as specified by the site) during the merge process, and multiple pairs can be merged in a single process.  However, only one merge process should be running at once.
Although the software was designed with potential to merge New Person records, this capability is not included in the released version.

Comments for previous Transaction(s) will continue to be available when accessing the CMT Add/View Comments action from the ECME User Screen (current functionality).
-Enhanced in November 2017 to extend the capabilities of the electronic pharmacy (ePharmacy) billing system to include the new action PR (Print Reports) added to the VER (View ePharmacy Rx) option, and to update the CV (Change View) action on the ECME User Screen to allow a user to revert back to the user's saved/preferred view and exit the CV action. The ECME AUTO-REVERSAL PROCESS email bulletin was updated to include the patient's eligibility and the drug name.. The system was also updated to support new data elements and fields for NCPDP Telecommunications versions published through October 2016. The Claim Log and the Claim Response Inquiry was updated to include the Facility ID Qualifier and the Reconciliation ID, and Option PHAR (Edit ECME Pharmacy Data) was updated to require entry for the prompt AUTO-REVERSAL PARAMETER. Finally, this release rectified an ongoing problem in which some TRICARE and CHAMPVA prescriptions on the CMOP queue would be left on the queue during CMOP processing because claim responses would not be received by VistA in a timely manner.  This release modifies the claim submission process and the CMOP process so that certain checks will no longer be performed prematurely, allowing sufficient time for the claim responses to come back.
-Enhanced in August 2018 to extend the capabilities of the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) electronic pharmacy (ePharmacy) billing system. Several filters on the Change View (CV) action of ECME User Screen are being updated to allow the user to select one, many, or all. The user will also now be able to select a specific date range.

Full Description and Features: 
This project was initially undertaken in response to Item #22 in the "Report of Task Force to Review Enrollment, Means Testing and Income Verification" (a.k.a. Rossio Report) dated December 15, 2000. In the area of Means Test (MT) Deficiencies, Item #22 required that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) identify best practices for means testing and acquiring veterans’ signatures at the local level and explore the promulgation of these best practices throughout the system. Until Patch EAS*1*3 was released in April 2002, there were no provisions within Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) functionality that prevented the scheduling of future appointments for patients who required a MT. Patch EAS*1*3 (April 2002) provided a national patch release to the Enrollment Application Systems (EAS) software of locally implemented software that had been converted from Class III to Class I. 
This application originally generated letters notifying veterans subject to means testing of yearly MT expiration, but that feature is obsolete.  With patch DG*5.3*858 in March 2014, annual MT renewal was discontinued and a Veterans Financial Assessment (VFA) Start Date of 1/1/13 was put into place.  Now, a non-exempt veteran is required to have only one MT that was less than one year old as of 1/1/13, and that MT should remain valid throughout the future.   Local means test reminder letters were discontinued by patch EAS*1*106 as part of the DG*5.3*858 build.

Full Description and Features: 
Clinical Health Data Repository (CHDR) shares computable health record data elements between DoD’s Clinical Data Repository (CDR) and VA’s Health Data Repository (HDR). Data are exchanged for patients identified and matched as Active Dual Consumers (ADCs) of both VA and DoD health care. VA and DoD conducted the first successful test of CHDR in a live patient environment in June 2006, and have since expanded.
One of the key features of CHDR is the exchange of standardized, computable (as opposed to textual) data. This "semantic interoperability" provides data that each agency can use with its own electronic decision support tools. In April 2007, VA released a program called Remote Data Interoperability (RDI), which extended the existing local Drug-Drug, and Drug-Allergy order checks to include data from all VA and DoD facilities at which a patient has been treated. This significantly increases patient safety by ensuring electronic decision support tools are based on all available electronic patient health record information rather than data from just one VistA computer system.

FHIE offers authorized VA clinicians, including those involved in claims adjudication, immediate access to DoD clinical data about service members who separate from the Armed Forces. FHIE supports DoD's and VA's goal of ensuring a smooth transition for Veterans from active military service to civilian life.
FHIE was deployed to all VA facilities in 2002, and supports the uni-directional exchange of health record data from the Department of Defense (DoD) to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The data exchange is in the form of textual reports via a secure shared data repository.
VHA clinicians and VBA claims staff access this data in the repository through Compensation and Pension Records Interchange (CAPRI). Information available through FHIE includes outpatient pharmacy (government and retail), allergy, laboratory (chemistry, hematology, anatomic pathology, surgical pathology, and cytology), radiology reports, consults, admission, discharge, transfer (ADT), and ambulatory coding data. DoD also has made pre-and post-deployment health assessment and post deployment health reassessment data available for viewing by VA through the FHIE framework.
See also Bidirectional Health Information Exchange (BHIE) Initiative.


FHIE supports the one-way transfer of historical data on separated and retired military personnel from DoD's Composite Health Care System to the FHIE Data Repository for use in VA clinical encounters, and potential future use for aggregate analysis. This data includes patient demographics, laboratory results, radiology reports, outpatient government and retail pharmacy information, admission discharge transfer (ADT) data, discharge summaries, consults reports, allergies and data from the DoD Standard Ambulatory Data Record. FHIE also supports the secure transfer of these FHIE data to Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) claims adjudicators for use in claims processing.

Full Description and Features: 
In today's health care environment, computer systems from multiple vendors and at geographically dispersed sites are used in conjunction with core facility computer systems to create integrated delivery of information to the end-user. Linking such systems to exchange data and work together is a non-trivial task, particularly given the complexity of health care data.
Health Level Seven (HL7) is an American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard messaging protocol that specifies the set of transactions and encoding rules for electronic data exchange between health care computer systems. HL7 provides an open, standards-based framework that computer systems can use to exchange health care data with each other. The HL7 standards development group is directly focused on health care informatics standards, and cooperates closely with developers of other standards.
The Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) HL7 package enables M- based (VistA) applications running on core facility computer systems to exchange health care information with other computer systems. It provides messaging services and a single toolset for M- based VistA applications to create, send, receive, and process HL7 messages.
Many VistA applications use VistA HL7 to exchange data in HL7 format with other facilities and/or applications, including Anesthesiology, Master Veteran Index/Patient Demographics (MVI/PD), Laboratory, Outpatient Pharmacy, Patient Management System (PMS), Radiology, and Veteran ID Card (VIC). The VistA HL7 package is also used to integrate commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) health care applications with M-based core facility computer systems.


•	Communication: Facilitates Point-to-Point and Publish-and-Subscribe messaging between two or more applications; and provides the transport mechanism using HL7-supported lower level transmission protocols (e.g., Hybrid Lower Level Protocol [HLLP], X3.28, or Minimum Lower Level Protocol [MLLP] over Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol [TCP/IP]), which provide error detection and session control; provides dynamic routing of messages.
•	Processing: Queues incoming and outgoing messages for reliable messaging; validates HL7 Message Header (MSH) information for all incoming messages; and sends HL7 acknowledgment (ACK) messages back to sending applications upon message receipt.
•	Message Administration: Provides functionality to assist the application developer in setting up HL7 interfaces by hiding the complex lower level communication; monitors message transmissions statuses; and provides reports on pending transmissions and those with errors.
•	Programming Utilities: Provides the developer with a rich collection of Application Program Interfaces (API) to facilitate the creation, exchange, and transmission of messages; provides a set of predefined variables to use for building HL7 messages/segments; automatically creates all HL7 Message Header (MSH) segments; and invokes the appropriate application routine to process message data when a message is received.

The Unwinder is a utility that is used in conjunction with the Protocol file (#101) to create modular building blocks for applications.
The Unwinder allows hierarchical traversing of menus, as found in Menu Management, and also the structuring of order protocols into independent, reusable modules. Each node becomes a "building block" from which more sophisticated modules may be built. For instance, the node "Order Shirt" may have as sub-items, "Get Size," "Get Color," "Get Style," and "Get Delivery Date." Each of these sub-items may, in turn, be used to build other modules.

Provisions have been made to allow additional building blocks to be placed at the item level of the node. Their purpose is to allow modifying actions to be executed and thus increase the flexibility of each module.

VHA Portfolio: Common Services

VASI ID: NA

Full Description and Features: 
The National Patch Module (NPM) software provides a database for the distribution of software patches and updates to Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA).
Options are provided for:
•	Systematic entry and review of patches by developers
•	Review and completion of patches by Software Quality Assurance (SQA)
•	Review and release of patches by Health Product Support (HPS)
•	Display and distribution of the verified/released patches to the users in the field
Once a problem is identified and a solution found or an enhancement is requested in VistA software, a developer enters a patch in the NPM. The patch is identified by software namespace, version, and a patch number. At this point, the patch entry has a status of "UNDER DEVELOPMENT" and is accessible only by other developers of the software. Once the developer has finished coding the patch and it's ready for review, SQA reviews the patch. Once SQA has reviewed the patch and no changes are required, SQA changes the status to "COMPLETED/UNVERIFIED." After the patch is completed, EVS reviews the patch. Once EVS makes the determination that it is ready for release, application coordinators/release agent change the status to "VERIFIED."
The patch is then automatically distributed and becomes available for users in the field.


Creates a patch mail message with text and installable routines that is delivered to all the sites via network mail. It allows entry of associated (dependent) patches (i.e., those patches that must be reviewed and installed prior to the current patch).
Provides flags to:
•	Identify which routines in a patch have previous patches
•	Hold verification/release of a patch until a certain date
•	Force sequential verification/release of associated patches.
Provides numerous reports including:
•	Verified patches and summaries
•	Completed/unverified patches for a selected package
•	Under development patches for a selected package
•	Provides automatic notification of new released patches
•	Provides ability to copy information from an existing patch into a new patch

VHA Portfolio: Business Informatics

VASI ID: 1492

Full Description and Features: 
PATS is a centralized, JEE light-client application, used by Patient Advocates via a browser, at each VA healthcare facility, to manage, record and resolve veteran (patient) compliments and complaints, regarding the veteran’s care and interactions at the facility serving them, so that issues are addressed in a convenient and timely manner. 
In 2007, PATS, as part of the VistA application reengineering effort, replaced the legacy VistA Patient Representative application which had been used at VA Medical Centers (VAMC) in prior years by Patient Representatives for this purpose.  Use of PATS was originally mandated as the VA's System of Record for patient (veteran) concerns, through the National Veterans Service & Advocacy Program and VHA Support Service Center, in VHA Directive 1003, and was, in 2011, brought under business ownership of the Office of Patient Centered Care & Cultural Transformation (OPCC) Veterans Experience Program, within the Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Ops and Mgt (DUSHOM), with continuation of its recognition as System-of-Record.
Patient Advocates use a cooperative effort with the patient, health care providers, and other employees at the healthcare facility, to facilitate expression and resolution of the patient’s concerns.  These patient encounters, created, recorded and managed by Patient Advocates in PATS as Reports of Contact (ROCs), may originate from a variety of sources including the patient, family members, congressional members and Veterans service organizations on behalf of the Veterans receiving care at VA facilities, by direct contact with Patient Advocates or via the Inquiry Routing and Information System (IRIS), after inquirers contact the IRIS Agents.
Besides its function of assisting in resolving patient-centered concerns, PATS also provides reports capabilities for assessment of complaint trends based on its data, providing trending feedback to the healthcare facility healthcare providers, customer care, and quality control managers, for recognition of and improvement of quality of care, and for adherence to best practices.
The patient-centered activity, Patient Advocate interactions, recordation of these ROCs in the PATS database, and trending for quality management, are all in alignment with the System-of-Record recognition of PATS in the Federal Register, visible directly at: https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2009-06-03/pdf/E9-12954.pdf, or by publications search from that page: http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys ’patient advocate tracking system’.
DUSHOM’s Office of Patient Advocacy Veterans Experience Program Leadership, use metrics and trending information from PATS Reports of Contact data, in their mission of oversight, national guidance, technical support, and education efforts for Patient Advocate staff within the broader context of the enhancement of the Veteran experience and patient centered care.
PATS is accessed, via https secure socket connections, through a browser, by Patient Advocates, to document, track, and report patient-related issues.  Interoperating technologies include this Java Enterprise Edition (J2EE) application, running within the Weblogic application suite, which is running on servers at the hosting facility, with backup/disaster recovery servers located at another standby hosting facility.  This Java application interoperates, via jdbc, with the Oracle database running on the database server, for dynamic transaction-based database updates.  PATS also interoperates with each of the 100+ VistA legacy systems (VAMCs) for user authentication and authorization and employee/patient lookup, via connections known as VistaLink Services, which use VistaLink transport layer protocol for networked communication.  For reporting and trending purposes, new transactions are migrated nightly, to the PATS-Reports database on the PATS-Reports server.  This feature of PATS is directly available to Patient Advocates, during normal login sessions in the PATS user interface.  In development are new PIV-managed processes with Two-Factor Authentication-single signon functionality, such that the role-use of PATS features is managed by the Role Based Access Control authorization process:
•	The user opens PATS login page in their browser (also known as Application landing).
•	They select that station into-which they intend to start a PATS session.
•	The PATS application, running in WebLogic at the host in Hines, receives their click.
•	PATS retrieves the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) xml token for this user, from the identity provider (IDP) identity repository. This token is validated at the target VistA environment, allowing the user roles to be retrieved by subsequent calls to the corresponding VistA RPCs.
•	The PATS application validates this SAML token, authorizing the user for access to PATS.
•	The user's PATS session object is constructed, enabling use of the role-based PATS features.
•	The user interface is presented to the user.
Reports are available within PATS, showing detailed transaction data of the ROCs for detail reports, and counting reports used for trending.  Patient Advocates generate site-specific reports, revealing ROC counts, types and occurrences of issue codes (some issue codes are identified and distinguishable also as ‘customer service standards’) assigned in ROCs, and other patterns, for a fiscal year or date range, for review by Facility Administrators, Quality managers and Service managers.  Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) Patient Advocate Coordinators generate similar VISN-scoped reports for review by VISN Directors.  Central Office and National Program Office PATS managers generate national-scope reports, revealing usage patterns, to help the PATS National Director oversee the mission and usefulness of the PATS application, and to discover national VA-wide patterns of activity to aid in the mission of the VHA Office of Patient Advocacy to enhance the Veteran's experience.  These reports provide feedback to aid in pattern assessment for quality management to facilitate best practice and care for the Veterans.  Some transaction data is also transmitted weekly to the VHA Support Service Center (VSSC) which provides additional report views.
PATS is supported by the VA's multi-tiered support network, including the national Health Product Support PATS team, and regional, VISN and local IT support teams.  When the Health Product Support PATS team requires Developer or infrastructure consultation, they consult with Developers from the Tier 3 Sustainment Administrative team, and other infrastructure and common-services teams such as Database Administrators from the Administrative Data Repository in Austin, DBAs from the VA IT Engineering Enterprise Health Solutions at Hines, and Server Administrators at the Capital Regional Data Center in Martinsburg WV.
Since the fall of 2019, the PATS Replacement application (PATS-R) (also known as PATSR) is being incrementally deployed for use by Patient Advocates at all medical treating facilities, for a transition of application use from PATS to PATSR which is occurring during 2020.  When the transition is complete, use of PATS will be terminated for all Patient Advocate users.  Following that, PATS database will be migrated to a PATSR auxiliary platform, to make it available to Patient Advocates as an archive of encounters, after-which PATS will be decommissioned.

PATS enables users to perform the following tasks:
•	Add a Report of Contact (ROC) which details a Veteran’s issue (compliment or complaint).
•	Edit, close, reopen, and delete an ROC
•	Send Informational Notifications to communicate an issue to an employee involved in a Report of Contact and/or the employee’s supervisor
•	Send Action Request Notifications, which require a response from the individual regarding action to be taken or next steps
•	Generate site-specific and National reports
•	Create ad hoc reports
•	Display reports online and save them in a variety of formats (Word, Excel, PDF files)
Enhanced in April 2013 to introduce the Inquiry Routing and Information System (IRIS) functionality.  A new feature allows the IRIS Agent to transmit an IRIS inquiry to PATS, as a new ROC.  PATS automatically rolls up data to the VISN Support Service Center to provide additional National reports. The PATS application is deployed at the Capital Region Readiness Center in Martinsburg WV, and is managed by the Health Systems Implementation, Training, and Enterprise Support team.

Business Function Framework Line(s) of Business: Provide Health Care Administration

Business Function Framework Function(s): Perform Hospital Administration

VHA Portfolio: 

VASI ID: 1530

Full Description and Features: 
The mission of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the Office of Information and Technology (OIT), and the Veteran Heath Administration (VHA) is to provide benefits and services to Veterans of the United States.  In meeting these goals, OIT strives to provide high-quality, effective, and efficient Information Technology (IT) services to those responsible for providing care to the Veterans at the point-of-care as well as throughout all the points of the Veterans’ health care in an effective, timely, and compassionate manner.
VHA has developed a Primary Care (PC) system that balances productivity with quality, access, and patient service. Management of patient panels in PC through mandatory and consistent use of the Patient-Centered Management Module (PCMM) has supported this system redesign. In a PC setting and in the Patient-Aligned Care Team (PACT) model, patients are assigned a Primary Care Provider (PCP) who is responsible for delivering essential health care, coordinating all health care services, and serving as the point of access for VA care.  The PCP works together with a team of professionals which includes nurses, pharmacists, social workers, health care professions, trainees, clerks, and more.
The PCMM Web software is considered to be an important component in measuring patient demand and PCP capacity to meet that demand, as well as reduce wait times. It allows users to set up and define treatment teams, assign positions to the team, assign staff to positions, assign patients to the team, and assign patients to a PCP.  PCMM Web was developed to assist VA facilities in implementing PC.  PCMM Web supports both PC and non-PC teams. Teams are groups of staff members organized for a certain purpose.
The PCMM software will be referred to as PCMM Web.  It is a National website and contains data for all sites.  It will replace the current PCMM software accessible on the user’s desktop.  An integral part of PCMM Web is the Data Migration that migrates the data from Legacy PCMM to PCMM Web.  It is accessed via the VA intranet by users who have been trained and granted access.  The main users of PCMM Web are PCMM Coordinators, Mental Health Treatment Coordinators, Transition and Care Management Coordinators, and Travelling Veteran Coordinators.  PCMM Web retrieves provider and patient data from VistA via VistALink and interfaces with the Master Veteran Index via HL7 and Java to validate each patient’s national identity.  PCMM Web synchronizes data back to the VistA PCMM files so it can continue to be accessed by existing software that currently utilizes it.

•	Enables a team to be formed based on specific Care Type (i.e., Primary Care, Mental Health) and aligned around a patient, including providers across multiple VA sites and in non-VA settings for efficient care coordination and communication. Team and Patient management is possible through interactive screens with navigation links, expandable sections, and actions icons, providing an overall view of care coverage and maintenance capabilities.
•	Identifies team members and specialists (VA and non-VA) involved in the care of the patient, as well as their contact information and provide modalities to facilitate provider-to-provider communication.
•	Enables users to set up and define a healthcare team, assign staff and health professionals to positions within the team, assign patients to the team, and assign patients to practitioners, including trainees. Teams can be grouped together for a larger collaborative team.
•	Quickly generates a team based on a modeled configuration for a specific team care type with team positions included, eliminating the need to manually create each team and position.
•	Supports automated data collection for management metrics and analysis related to access, workload, and panel management for Multiple PACT functionality at the team level. 
•	Patients assigned to Primary Care teams are assigned as “Pending” until a Primary Care encounter is verified by a Primary or Secondary Provider, who is also a teamlet of the assigned team. The assignment then changes to “Active”.  If there is an Active assignment and a Pending assignment for a patient at the same site and when a qualifying PC encounter is detected for the Pending assignment, an intra-facility transfer will be executed by the System. The Active assignment will be inactivated and the Pending assignment will be Activated. The patient can be assigned to the “Team” (i.e., the Primary Care Provider and the teamlet inherits the assignment) or to the “Associate Provider” that has a valid preceptor relationship established.
•	Patient assignments to Primary Care teams are interrogated nightly to verify for Automatic Inactivation. An established assignment without activity for 24 months is automatically inactivated due to inactivity. A new assignment without activity for 12 months is automatically inactivated due to inactivity. The PCMM user is notified of the pending inactivation three months prior to the automatic inactivation. Reports are also available.
•	Identifies and tracks patient assignments across stations. A Multiple PACT request enables a patient to be assigned to multiple PACT teams as required for care coverage across VA systems. This request requires an approval or a denial from all involved stations. Multiple assignment requests for the same patient for different stations are allowed, but there can only be one active assignment per patient, per station at a time.
•	Patients assigned to non-primary care teams (i.e., Mental Health or specialty) must be assigned to specific providers within the team.
•	Search capabilities enable a user to quickly search for a patient, team, room, group, or staff member for assignment/unassignment management through interactive screens and menu options. To expand a search outside of PCMM Web, a user can search for a patient through VistA.
•	Quickly assign or reassign one or more patient to and from a team or a position using a batch process, instead of manually performing the tasks one-by-one.
•	Enables clinical reviews and approvals to reinforce status activity and assignment management.
•	One or more users at each physical site (i.e., hospital, clinic) in the VA hold roles within the PCMM Web application (such as PCMM Coordinator, Traveling Veteran Coordinator, VISN Coordinator, and National Administrator). Each role has associated access privileges which enables the user to perform functions within PCMM Web.
•	Eligible preceptor relationships are managed through team position profiles.
•	Manage how reference data displays in PCMM Web by enabling the definition of your own reference values.
•	Summarizes alert notifications per station for a user to quickly identify alert types and act accordingly.
•	Defines the appropriate team members to receive notifications (i.e., MailMan messages) concerning patient assignments. Notifications are sent to all team patients, positions, or preceptors or set as “Do Not Send”, indicating no notifications are sent.
•	PCMM Web utilizes Microsoft SQL Report Server for its reporting capabilities. Canned and AdHoc reports are available.

VHA Portfolio: Health Provider Systems

VASI ID: 1790

Full Description and Features: 
The Drug Accountability/Inventory Interface works toward perpetual inventory for each VA medical facility pharmacy by tracking all drugs through pharmacy locations. Drugs are added to the appropriate pharmacy locations as they are received from the Prime Vendor. This allows sites to receive invoice information containing data for confirmed orders. With the prime vendor, the data is uploaded into VistA using a Graphical User Interface to perform the upload. The files are uploaded into Drug Accountability, processed, and upon verification, the pharmacy locations or master vaults are updated. Dispensing data is collected from pharmacy packages to decrement balances. Drug Accountability also provides the capability for Pharmacy personnel to display or print procurement history, drug balance adjustments, and order data.

There are two primary methods of receiving invoice data into Drug Accountability:
•	Prime Vendor Data
•	IFCAP Data
Both methods involve having the user place the invoice orders with the appropriate company. With the prime vendor, the data is uploaded into VistA using a Graphical User Interface to perform the upload. With IFCAP, the data is automatically shipped to VistA upon receipt at the warehouse.
The Prime Vendor Interface includes the following features:
•	It automatically updates the Drug Accountability pharmacy locations based on dispensing and receiving information, and it also updates master vaults based on receiving information.
•	Drugs are added as the invoice data is received.
•	If the invoiced drug’s order unit and dispense units per order unit are the same as the information currently contained  in  the local DRUG file, the NDC field  in  the DRUG file is overwritten with the most recent National Drug Code (NDC) number.
•	The reorder quantities for the pharmacy locations and master vaults are provided on a daily basis by way of a mail message.
•	The IFCAP Interface includes the following features:
•	When a pharmacy order invoice is received and entered into the IFCAP purchasing system, the receipt data will be collected  and  compiled to an Health  Level  Seven  (HL7) message and transmitted ‘real time’ to VistA Drug Accountability.
•	Upon receiving the message, the receipt data will be stored in a temporary global, and Drug Accountability will alert the user about the Pharmacy receipt.
•	After receiving invoice data into the warehouse, the transmission from IFCAP will place data into a temporary global.
•	When Pharmacy personnel sign into the Drug Accountability package, the program will check for the existence of orders to process.
•	If the orders exist, and the user has the proper security key, the data can then be received into Drug Accountability.
•	Each Purchase Order received will be for a specific pharmacy location. If items are to be shipped/received at different pharmacy locations, a different purchase order will be created/shipped for each location.
•	Both Interfaces include the following features:
•	Vendorspecific information and procurement history is displayed for a selected drug.
•	Pharmacy locations are established and populated.
•	A purge capability with scheduling queuing is provided.
•	Support is provided for NDC code set and pricing for Electronic Claims Management Engine pharmacy electronic billing.

VASI ID: 1588

Full Description and Features: 
Pharmacy Enterprise Customization System (PECS) is a Java 2 Enterprise
Edition (J2EE) application used to research, review, report, and manage
customized drug information from First Data Bank's (FDB) Drug Information Framework (FDB-DIF),
which is a Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) product, used in the enhanced order
checking process.
The PECS application, through a web-based Graphical User Interface (GUI),
allows VHA pharmacists and clinicians to research and request custom
changes to Drug-Drug Interaction, Drug Pairs, Dose Range, Duplicate
Therapy, and Professional Monograph records, controlling access through a
role based authorization. VHA Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM)
periodically (as needed in support of VA procedures and priorities)
prepare, review and approve the customizations, which result in VA Custom
drug data, which will supersede or enhance the industry standard FDB-drug
data.
The advantages to the VA for using PECS are as follows:
•	All customizations will be performed at the National level to provide consistent order checks between facilities.
•	Use of First Databank for drug interaction, duplicate therapy, and dosing data.
•	More specificity in drug interaction order checks with the ability to include or exclude dose routes.
•	More specificity in duplicate therapy order checks with FDB data.
•	Weekly FDB updates with monthly customization updates.
•	More frequent customization updates when needed.
PECS does the following:
•	Allows users to customize the FDB standard reference tables used in the enhanced order checking that will be used by the Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) group, Pharmacy Informaticist, and National Drug File (NDF) managers or designees to enter and update the custom table values.
•	Allows users to do the following customizations:
o	A custom drug-drug interaction, and any important attributes for that interaction.
o	Drug pairs associated with a custom drug-drug interaction.
o	A custom Professional Monograph for a drug-drug interaction, including any important attributes.
o	A custom duplication allowance value for a duplicate therapy class.
o	Custom values for attributes associated with a custom dose range check table.
•	Provides a Searching capability for a user to see Drug-Drug Interaction, Duplicate Therapy, or Professional Monograph information separately or together, for chosen drugs.
•	Provides the following reports:
o	History of custom changes for each of the five concepts.
o	Exportable FDB or Custom Data - Individual query data can be exported from the five FDB-DIF or Custom tables. The available format is Excel.
o	FDB Comparison Reports to compare incoming updated FDB data against VA customized data to help determine if the VA customized data needs to be modified.
•	Provides a process via File Transfer Protocol (FTP) to transfer Custom data from a National server to all local/regional instances servers.
•	Leverages the existing FDB data loader utility at each site that is used to update the FDB-DIF databases.
o	Custom table content distribution involves using an automated utility, Data Update (DATUP). The distribution method supports the following data content scenarios:
•	Only FDB standard reference table data
•	FDB standard reference table data and Custom table data
•	Only Custom table data
Custom table content distribution supports both periodic and as-needed releases.

VASI ID: 1518

Full Description and Features: 
The PPS-N and the PPS-L Migration projects provide two distinct capabilities that are included in the same application which is part of Pharmacy Re-Engineering (PRE) initiatives within VHA. The Pharmacy Product System (PPS) is intended to improve the VA’s formulary processes.  PPS is envisioned as two distinct processes. The first process covers PPS at the national level (called PPS-N). The PPS-N environment provides for the ability to manage pharmacy-specific data across the enterprise, ensuring that all facilities are using the same base data for their operations. The second process encompasses PPS processes at the local level (called PPS-L). The PPS-L application environment will provide services that enact business logic for the daily operations of pharmacy users at the VA’s medical centers and clinics.

The PPS-N application allows national VA personnel to more easily, quickly and safely manage the VA National Formulary which directs which products, such as medications and supplies, are to be purchased and used by the VA hospital system.The key capabilities are:
•	Provide a means for users to manage the National VA Formulary items. This includes being able to request the addition and update of items, and then approve these requests.
•	Provide a means to synchronize PPS-N data with NDFMS.
•	Provide a means to interface with a third-party commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) drug data source.
Via this interface PPS-N:
•	Provides a means for users to manage additions and changes made in the COTS drug data source, including synchronization of this data with the PPS-N Enterprise Product List (EPL).
•	Provides a means for users to search for data within the COTS drug data source.
•	Provides a means for users to manage the mapping of VA concepts to COTS concepts.
•	Provides a means for users to perform reports on items added by the COTS drug data source.
•	Provide a means for users to perform various simple and advanced searches for item data contained within PPS-N.
•	Provide a means for users to perform reports on the item data contained within PPS-N.
•	Provide a means to retrieve pricing information from the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) system, and then to display this information to the PPS-N users.
•	Provide a means to retrieve Standard Medication Route information from the VA Enterprise Terminology System (VETS), and then to manage this data within PPS-N.
•	Provide a process executed on the legacy NDFMS system to support data synchronization with the PPS-N database.

Brief Description: 
Legacy Primary Care Management Module (PCMM GUI) is no longer in use and has been replaced by Patient Centered Management Module (PCMM Web).
PCMM allows users to create, manage, and define teams and assign staff to these teams. This funtion helps in maintaining accurate listings for primary care teams and panels.

Business Function Framework Line(s) of Business: Provide Health Care Administration

Business Function Framework Function(s): Perform Hospital Administration

VHA Portfolio: 

VASI ID: 1530

Full Description and Features: 
In the outpatient setting, patients are assigned a primary care team and provider who are responsible for delivering essential health care, coordinating all health care services, and serving as the point of access for specialty care. Associate Primary Care Providers (APs) provide primary care to patients under the supervision of the Primary Care Provider (PCP). PCMM supports both primary and non-primary care teams such as OIF/OEF and Mental Health Treatment teams. The software allows users to create, manage, and define teams; create, manage and assign positions to the teams; assign staff to the positions; and assign patients to positions.
In PCMM, primary care providers have an assigned "number of patients allowed" which is compared with the "number of patients actual" to determine if more patients may be assigned to the provider. PCMM functionality assists in maintaining accurate, active patient listings for primary care teams and panels. By unassigning patients who have not seen their primary care providers in a specified amount of time, new patients may be assigned. Unassigned patients may be readily reassigned to their previous primary care team and provider if they return for care. When the maximum number of patients is reached, sites may override the maximum number allowed or add the patient to the Electronic Wait List. PCMM Wait List reports assist in the management of patients awaiting a primary care team or provider assignment.
 
PCMM allows entry of the providers FTEE to track the amount of time the APs and PCPs spend providing direct primary care and measures the capacity of each institution (and VHA as a whole) to provide outpatient primary care. PCMM also screens staff assignments to PCP and AP positions to assure the data on providers is correct.
 
The primary care patient, provider, and team information captured in PCMM is sent to the Austin Information Technology Center (AITC) and the National Patient Care Database. Some PCMM information is available on the VHA Support Service Center (VSSC) website. Additionally, the Office of Performance and Quality Measures utilizes PCMM data for national reporting and performance measures.

One of the challenges in creating such applications is establishing communication between the client workstation and VistA's M-based servers. In a secure manner over a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) network, users need to be able to log onto a server, initiate activities on the server, and retrieve and update data on the server.  VistA's Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Broker software provides functionality so that GUI developers can:Establish a connection from a client workstation to a VistA M Server.  Run RPCs on the VistA M Server.Return data to the client workstation.  The VistA M Server continuously runs an RPC Broker listener process whose purpose is to establish connections with clients. When the listener process receives a connection request from a client, it spawns a separate handler process, which then handles all communications with the client.  Once connected, the client can execute Remote Procedure Calls on the VistA M Server. RPCs are written in M and accessed through the VistA M Server's REMOTE PROCEDURE file (#8994).

Full Description and Features: 
The CHDR generates standards-based, computable electronic health record (EHR) data elements between DoD’s Clinical Data Repository (CDR) and VA’s Health Data Repository (HDR) for patients identified and matched as Active Dual Consumers (ADCs) of both VA and DoD health care.
Clinical data for these "dual consumers" (patients receiving healthcare or expected to receive healthcare at both VA and DoD medical facilities.)  Data for patients is stored at each agency’s local healthcare systems: at DoD this occurs in the Clinical Data Repository (CDR), a component of the Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application (AHLTA).  At VA, the Health Data Repository (HDR) stores the CHDR data. 
The CHDR system is the link between the two repositories, and once the patient is marked "active," the data exchange is enabled.Most patients marked active are so marked by the DoD automated process. At VA, patients can be marked "active" manually, using the CHDR Administration Application Interface (CHDR Admin GUI.) 
After the computed data is exchanged, it can be used by each agency’s native healthcare information system. At VA, the integrated data can be viewed through VistAWeb while triggered Drug/Drug and/or Drug Allergy alerts will manifest in the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS.)

Full Description and Features: 
In 2003, Enterprise Terminology Services (ETS) was formed as a subproject of the Health Data Repository (HDR) project to help standardize the terminology reference files that are used by Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) applications through the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). In FY06, ETS merged with the Data Standardization (DS) and Standard Data Service (SDS) project teams into one team, becoming Standards & Terminology Services (STS).
Historically, VistA applications were developed in a decentralized manner and could be specialized in response to the needs of individual medical centers. As a result, VistA terminologies were not always standardized. Today, there is a shift toward enterprise-wide terminology standards, which are essential to establish consistency in meaning of data within VHA as a whole. The shift from dispersed, non-standard terminologies to a controlled, centralized terminology helps VHA meet requirements for an authoritative, longitudinal, accessible, and portable electronic health record (EHR).
STS has worked closely with VHA stakeholders and partners to develop and maintain both the Enterprise Reference Terminology (ERT) content and VHA Enterprise Terminology Services (VETS) application and runtime services. STS software includes databases and tools that are used to maintain terminology content. ERT content ranges from simple lists of standardized terms to reference terminologies with fully populated semantics such as the National Drug File Reference Terminology (NDF-RT).
VETS software includes the databases and services that provide the terminology content to STS stakeholders. VETS includes deployment and application runtime services that will provide common access to ERT content in both the current VistA and future My HealtheVet VistA environments. STS has created and documented a Terminology Model, which will be used internally to structure ERT data and to provide services to VHA clinical applications. The model also supports data interchange within VHA and with various government and commercial partners.
The VETS applications are:
NTRT (New Term Rapid Turnaround)
A web application that is has two groups of users: external request submitters and internal
terminologists. Clinicians from the VA Medical Centers obtain an NTRT login (provided by STS) that enables them to request new terms to be added to the standardized VistA packages (Allergies, Vitals, TIU, Pharmacy). When a request is submitted, STS terminologists then use the NTRT application to track the request through a review process to determine if the request is valid.
TDS (Terminology Deployment Services)
A web application that only STS terminologists use to version and deploy standardized VHAT
(VHA Terminology) content and Map Sets. NTRT requests that are approved are versioned in
TDS and after a rigorous testing process are deployed to all 129 VistA production sites using TDS.
Terminology Browser
A web application that is available to the entire VA enterprise. This tool allows users to browse
Standard Code Systems (SCS) like SNOMED or ICD-9, Map Sets that contain mappings, and
VHAT terminology by domain (e.g. Allergies) or subset (e.g. Reactions). This tool was published in VETS v9.
TED (Terminology Editor)
A web application that allows STS terminologists to author new Map Sets that contain mappings.  This is a Graphical User Interface editor tool that was created to replace importing content using XML files. This is new for VETS v10.
VUID (VHA Unique Identifier Service)
A web application that allows users that have a valid login (both internal and external to STS) to
request one or more VUIDs to use for terminology standardization purposes.

VASI ID: 1619

Full Description and Features: 
Mental Health Services (MHS) is currently managing a web-based application (herein referred to as the Veterans Crisis Line Application (VCL)) utilized by their confidential, free 24-hours hotline staff to make referrals to the appropriate field-based Suicide Prevention Coordinators (SPCs).
History:  VCL Project is an important function to support recent suicide prevention legislation.  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has begun operation of the national suicide prevention hotline (now called VCL) to ensure that veterans with emotional crises have round-the-clock access to trained professionals.  The VA is partnering with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline to operate the national hotline. Veterans can call 1-800-273-TALK (8255) and press "1" to reach the VA hotline, which is staffed by mental health professionals 24/7/365 in Canandaigua, N.Y. who work closely with the callers’ local VA Suicide Prevention Coordinators and mental health providers to help the callers.
Legislation has been passed requiring VHA to take specific actions in the effort to prevent Veteran suicides. On November 6, 2007, President Bush signed into law the Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act.  It’s named after a soldier who committed suicide in Grundy County, Iowa, in December 2005, after serving an 11-month tour in Iraq.  The bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to meet deadlines in providing the following services:
•	Train VA staff on suicide prevention and mental health care
•	Staff each VA medical facility with a suicide prevention counselor
•	Screen soldiers who seek care through the VA for mental health needs
•	Support outreach and education for veterans and their families
•	Research the most effective strategies for suicide prevention
•	Create a peer support counseling program so veterans can help other veterans
However, while the bill requires the VA to provide these services, it provides no funding.
On February 6, 2008, Representative Leonard Boswell (D-IA) and Representative Robin Hayes (R-NC) introduced the Armed Forces Suicide Prevention Act (H.R. 5223).  This bill is focused on Department of Defense implementing a comprehensive suicide prevention program within all branches in the military, including National Guard and the Reserves.  The Air Force implemented a suicide prevention program in the 1990’s.  By 2002, the suicide rate had declined by 33% and researchers found a decrease in violent crime and family violence after program implementation.  This bill is designed to help the VA and Department of Defense deal with the increase in mental health needs of Iraq and Afghanistan service personnel. Both VA Central Office and Congress want periodic reports relating to Veteran suicide and suicide prevention efforts.
Tracking cases may also allow for best practice identification. The Suicide Prevention Hotline Web Application went live, nationwide, on 6/9/2009 and the first update was put into production on 11/22/2010.Description of Current VCL Application: The VCL application provides an electronic version of the call log via a web-based application. VCL also stores information from hotline calls, which provides the ability to retrieve and view call information as needed.  The VCL application has three components:
•	Log Application used at the VA Suicide Prevention Hotline by Health Services Specialist (HSS) to log calls
•	Response Application used at VA facilities by Suicide Prevention Coordinators (SPCs) to document referrals and save them in the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) as Progress Notes
•	Admin Component which is nested with the Health Techs (HT) application.  This component is used by hotline administrators and Social Services Assistants (SSA) to audit and administer the system
In the Admin view, the Log Application stores call information that can later be used for data collection and reporting purposes.
In the Admin view, the Log Application provides a mechanism for hotline staff to view Veteran demographic information.  The application also provides the risk assessment module and the ability to identify the VA Medical Center (VAMC) closest to the caller’s physical location.
In the admin view, the Log Application provides a means to refer a caller to a VAMC for follow-up care.  The referral is directed to the VA Medical Center’s SPC in real time.
The SPC Response Application allows the ability to document the hotline referral in CPRS in the form of a Text Integration Utility (TIU) Progress Note.
The SPC Response Application ensures all progress notes have a common note title.
The SPC Application is automatically updated when a SPC completes the referral process.

VPFS looks different from PFOP because it is a web-based application; however, its design and functionality are modeled after PFOP. You can perform all of the functions in VPFS that were available in PFOP, with the exception of a few functions that are no longer needed because of the new built-in security controls.One of the major changes is that VPFS is a centralized system. With PFOP, each site used a stand-alone copy of the software and there were differences between local versions, such as data structures, business rules, etc. With VPFS, all sites access the same centralized application using a web browser over the VHA secure Intranet. VPFS stores all data for all sites in one centralized database. Access to the data in the database is controlled by security software that limits access according to VistA site and user role.

Laboratory UI uses the standard messaging protocol Health Level Seven (HL7) to communicate with all instruments. HL7 is a standard developed by health care information systems professionals to simplify the communications between computer systems that must exchange information. HL7 was adopted by Decentralized Hospital Computer Program (DHCP) as the primary communications protocol for messaging between systems and even between applications on the same system...The laboratory technologist sees very little change between the Laboratory UI and the traditional interface system. After the Laboratory Information Manager (LIM) or ADPAC sets up the files and installs the new hardware, the technologist can accession, build Load/Work lists, download, and verify the results as usual. The benefit of using the Laboratory UI is that almost any instrument by any manufacturer can be interfaced quickly and dependably, in unidirectional or bidirectional mode. Interfacing is only subject to the limitations of the instrument.

VASI ID: 1483

Full Description and Features: 
The VSS application helps voluntary staff accomplish their tasks more easily through a Web-based graphical user interface. Users at the local and national level are able to generate a wider array of reports about volunteers and sponsoring organizations. In addition, volunteers are able to log their own hours and print meal tickets themselves at secure log-in "kiosks." VSS users interact directly with a national, centralized database, and consolidated national reporting no longer requires data transmissions back and forth between sites and the Austin Information Technology Center (AITC). Direct access to data provides instantaneous updates and up-to-minute reporting for all users. Central Office administrators and voluntary staff thus have broader and more reliable data for managing volunteer services.


•	Provides multi-lingual interaction with volunteers during log-in.
•	Supports and enhances security for multiple division facilities.
•	Displays/prints entire master record for a single volunteer.
•	Provides local printing of address labels and telephone lists.
•	Reduces workload required to input mass award code changes.

VASI ID: 2298

Full Description and Features: 
WebVRAM is a web-based, cloud-hosted application utilizing VA Enterprise Architecture and Design principles which facilitates Community of Care office staff, provider and clinician access to multiple remote Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA)\ Fee Basis Claims System (FBCS) and related business applications without requiring physician users to establish login authentication and credentials at each VistA where Veteran clinical data is related to the Veteran and includes all data associated with that Veteran that would be required to provide any clinical care. Clinical data will be viewed by any authorized VHA provider or clinical team providing healthcare to a specific Veteran at any location. The need for multiple VistA sessions, with separate user profile login to each VistA instance, is eliminated. WebVRAM will be available for internal VA use only, with no public facing portal.


•	WebVRAM is a web-based application, hosted in the Azure Cloud, accessed through a VA-internal URL.
•	There is no client-based component required on the user workstation.
•	WebVRAMm facilitates Community of Care office staff, provider and clinician access to multiple remote Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA)\ Fee Basis Claims System (FBCS) and related business applications without requiring physician users to establish login authentication and credentials at each VistA where Veteran clinical data is related to the Veteran and includes all data associated with that Veteran that would be required to provide any clinical care.
•	The current process of requesting access to multiple VistA instances, which is required by Telehealth providers, is not standardized or consistently defined across the enterprise and often necessitates time-consuming manual intervention to obtain access for each remote provider.
•	To eliminate delays and administrative workload caused by current VistA access request processes, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Office of Connected Care (OCC) has requested implementation of a solution that enables Telehealth providers and staff to efficiently obtain and maintain access to one, multiple, or all VA instances of the medical record using an intuitive user interface.
•	The class III VRAM effort originated in the Consolidated Patient Account Centers (CPAC) and is known as VRAM; this effort is the web version of VRAM.
•	With the cloud-hosted application, users of WebVRAM will continue to enjoy consistency in access to disparate VistA systems while system administrators and systems security personnel experience a reduction in account management activities and standardization of access according to nationally-approved access standards.
•	The web-based offering enhances the efficiency achieved by both OIT and Veterans Health Administration (VHA) business partners in obtaining access to disparate VistA systems and enterprise-wide data required to perform VA national-level program business functions.

Full Description and Features: 
Through a collaborative effort between VHA and DoD/DFAS, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was reached to provide defined data elements to DFAS for tracking of active duty service members who were admitted to VA inpatient facilities. The MOU established the authorities and agreement for the exchange of information relating to admissions and discharges from VA inpatient facilities of active duty personnel. There is a weekly collection process of admissions and discharges for active duty service members at each VA inpatient facility. This collection and consolidation of data into a single repository is reviewed and transmitted to DFAS to a central data collection point. Each facility runs the weekly background job which collects data based on admissions and discharges for patients with a Primary or Other Eligibility of TRICARE, SHARING AGREEMENT or OTHER FEDERAL AGENCY. Upon completion of the background job, VistA will send an email message to the local WII ADT REVIEWER mail group alerting facility staff on whether there are entries requiring approval. The message indicates either potential or no potential active duty admissions/discharges for the past week. If there were potential admissions/discharges, then the message will state there are active duty admissions, reflect the number of potential active duty admissions or discharges needing review, the record count, and the time period of the report. Staff will review and process those potential active duty cases.

Full Description and Features: 
The VistA Extensible Markup Language (XML) Parser is a full-featured, validating XML parser written in the M programming language and designed to interface with the VistA suite of M-based applications. It is not a standalone product. Rather, it acts as a server application that can provide XML parsing capabilities to any client application that subscribes to the application programmer interface (API) specification detailed in this document.
The VistA XML Parser employs two very different API implementations. The first is an event-driven interface that is modeled after the widely used Simple API for XML (SAX) interface specification. In this implementation, a client application provides a special handler for each parsing event of interest. When the client invokes the parser, it conveys not only the document to be parsed, but also the entry points for each of its event handlers. As the parser progresses through the document, it invokes the client’s handlers for each parsing event for which a handler has been registered.
The second API implementation is based on the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C’s) Document Object Model (DOM) specification. This API, which is actually built on top of the event-driven interface, first constructs an in-memory model of the fully parsed document. It then provides methods to navigate through and extract information from the parsed document.
